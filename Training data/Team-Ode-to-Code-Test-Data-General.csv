Artificial grass turf astroturf from Duke football field,Park Slope,$500 ,2,180,newyork.craigslist.org,0.041887283,"
        
We bought this for our backyard.
It was originally part of Duke Universityâ€™s football field so itâ€™s very high quality material and has an interesting history if youâ€™re a football fan. It even has some of the original football field lines.

$500 for a 12x25â€ piece

We have two pieces for sale at that size and they are $500 per piece.

This is not the cheap thin AstroTurf junk from Home Depotâ€”- this is heavy-duty, good quality with individual realistic grass blades.

Just one piece is probably big enough to turf most of a backyard, deck or rooftop. 

Photo shows the two pieces overlapping each other 

Itâ€™s perfect for putting down over a concrete backyard to make it safe for the kids or on a deck or rooftop to add some instant greenery.

Photos show it after a winter outside so it has some assorted toys and yard debris on it and has some wrinkles to it but it just needs to be pulled out flat again.

It is pretty heavy but I can help you load to your vehicle.    ",None,,,,,,

"Outdoor rubber tiles for deck, roof, backyard - great for kids play",Park Slope,$500 ,2,180,newyork.craigslist.org,0.038895369,"
        
High quality rubber playground tiles
We used these in the backyard to protect our kids from concrete floor but you could lay these on a rooftop deck, basement, or anywhere kids play

They are really thick, not the cheap thin ones, so offer true protection from falls

Each tile is about 20â€x36â€ and about 1 1/2â€ thick

This was the only photo I could find with them in use under a climbing structure. Currently they are all stacked up and ready for pick up. They do have some Signs of use anywhere, so a lot of it would clean up with a good pressure washing which I always meant to do but never got around to.

Enough tiles to cover about a 10x10â€™ space.

Easy pickup, just back up your car and Iâ€™ll help you load them.    ",None,,,,,,

I'm not sure what these are called, but they were used by the newspapers when the movie ads were placed in the newspapers by the folks who set the type and arranged the pages in the papers -- in the old days. 

You can tell they are old by the way they look and the paper is thick, not flimsy like if you made a copy from a copy machine.

WING CHUN TEC BOARD
BudoTec - Wing Chun Tec-Board - Large
 product is produced in Switzerland with the use of high-quality technologies and materials. For instance, the punch cushions, which are fitted with nanotechnology-treated synthetic leather - with the lotus blossom effect. As such, the punch cushions can be very easily cleaned. 

Furthermore, high-quality steels and the best beech wood were used.

Every device has three arm elements and a leg element, which can together be adjusted to 7344 different positions. The various adjustment positions were determined on the basis of the human body's geometric data and the techniques of Wing Chun. As such, nearly every imaginable training situation can be simulated. 

Every arm and leg unit is fitted with springs which were specially produced for these devices and correspond to the impacting forces of an average adult student. The impact of these forces trains the muscles specific to Wing Chun in particular, your stance is strengthened and the principles of Wing Chun, i.e. the receiving and redirecting of the opposite force, are strongly promoted. This results in a very real training experience. 

The Wing Chun Tec Board was constructed for the Dojo and, in particular, home use. The arms and leg can be removed and put away. The Tec Board remains fastened to the wall. The training device can, therefore, be used in very small spaces. 

Board measures : 140 cm x 40 cm x 6 cm (55.12 x 15.75 x 2.36 inches)
The weight of the large tec board only = 23.5 kg 
The weight of the small tec board only = 17.5 kg 
The weight of 1 arm = 1.6 kg 
The weight of 1 leg. = 4.3 kg 
Tec Arm = 40 cm long (15.74 in) 
Diameter = 50mm (1.96 inches)
The distance between the holes = 10 cm (3.9cm) (horiz and vert)
Between two devices should be a free space of 1.20 meter works perfectly. 
The leg 70cm high (from the center of attachment to bottom of leg). 
The bottom of the leg is 53cm from the wall when mounted. 
You want the bottom of the leg to be a minimum of 10 cm off the floor when mounted.

The spring is very dynamic but also creates good pressure on your arms:
To move the arm 5 cm (1.96 in) out of his normal position you need 5 Kg+ (11 lbs) of force.
To move the arm 8 cm (3.15 in) out of his normal position you need 10 Kg+ (22 lbs) of force.
""Best Technique Training, guaranteed"".

Shipping will take place via DPD from Switzerland. You will have to pay all the taxes/VAT for your country upon receiving the board (or when DPD bills you). Please be sure to pay them promptly so no extra charges accrue.
