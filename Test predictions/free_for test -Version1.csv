Note that the plug is 220V. Heaters at this level of wattage must be 220V.

Full size metal bed frame, cute and very solid- giving away instead of selling because some hardware needs replacing and it doesn't come with assembly directions. However! The pieces that need replacing should be really easy to find (I kept the old pieces so you can bring them to a home depot or hardware store to get exact replicas- they're screws with holes on top that fit a hex/allen key, the holes on a few of them are just stripped from previous assembly). I've also assembled and disassembled the frame multiple times and it's fairly simple, so I can explain it to you when you pick up and you can text me with any questions.

Private collection of vintage children's books,"
        
Two medium sized boxes of private collection of vintage books, good condition, mostly children's books from 1975-1989, UK publishers, for children 8-14yrs old. 

These were cherished books I grew up with in Guyana, South America, in the late 1970s. Being a former British colony, Guyana imported almost all their books from the UK. These are a snapshot of a bygone era when the UK was at its peak in its influence of world culture, and the history and culture contained within these pages offer a glimpse of the now anachronistic world view, sometimes naive, sometimes unrefined and bigoted, sometimes inaccurate, and often hilarious. I wish I could keep these, but I simply no longer have space for them in my tiny apartment.

The two boxes weigh about 10 pounds each, so you need either a car or a cart.

Computer Armoire,"
        
Large, heavy computer armoire with pull out keyboard shelf, lots of storage for CDs and other things.  It has a light and electrical wiring.

Aerobed Twin Air Mattress with Leak,"
        
This mattress was abandoned by its owner at an apartment that was vacated. It looks like it's in great condition, but did not stay firm overnight when I inflated it. It probably just needs a vinyl patch and would be in near-perfect condition. No spots or stains. Comes with an electric pump.

In the image it is shown partially deflated.    ",3.0
